Some things I played around with to understand them better. Fun stuff!

- **monads**:
  Simple implementation of the Reader monad, followed by a monad instance for functions

- **catamorphisms** (also called generic eliminators or recursion schemes):
  Catamorphism deconstruct a data structure and are a generalization of the concept of a fold.
  Instead of writing a recursive function on the data structure manually, you just pass the respective algebra (functions that describe how to deconstruct each constructor) to a generic eliminator.
  Thanks to Andor PÃ©nzes for exposing me to the idea! More information can be found on the [Haskell Wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/Catamorphisms).
